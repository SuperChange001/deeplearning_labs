# Deeplearning Labs

Deep Learning labs in Summer School on Data Science at AUA in Yerevan, Armenia 2022

## Structure
This repository contains materials from three Lab sessions:
- **Lab01**: First Steps with AI Programming
- **Lab02**: Image Recognition
- **Lab03**: Embedded Deep Learning

## Preparation
The first two sessions (**Lab01**, and **Lab02**) will mainly work with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Therefore, you would only need to prepare a laptop/PC with internet access and a web browser. It could be very convenient if you have a google account. With a google account, you can store your modified notebook on google drive.

However, the Seesion **Lab03** requires pre-installed softwares on your laptop/PC:
1. [VS Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
3. [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/blob/master/docs/tutorial/install.md)

*Tips:* It is recommended to try to install all the software before you come to the Lab. But, don't worry if you fail to install everything.
